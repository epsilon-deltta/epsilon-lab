## Abstract
In this post, I introduce three kinds of hyper-paramter tuning methods.
1. Grid Search
2. Randomized Search
3. Bayesian Search
Grid search is computation-consuming. Randomized Search is better than Grid Search 
in point of computation efficiency, and can set the number of iteration. bet can't reflect
past calculated results. Bayesian search is able to reflect the results.
And i will show interpretaion of the results. 
1. Predict the range of RMSE (using t-distribution or Normal distribution)

## Introduction
To set hyperparameters manually and train is so time-consuming.
So we need to make this system work automatically.
And Here're widely used simple methods. 
1. Grid Search
2. Randomized Search
3. Bayesian Search 

## Experments

## Conclusion
